# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Anwana Ntofon

### Day 1: October 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Start a small game that's based on shuffling three cups and finding a prize. Just HTML and CSS for now. JavaScript later perhaps?

**Thoughts** Not new to coding, but I still want to learn and strengthen fundamental concepts. For example, it took me way too long to center an 'a' tag. Nevertheless, I feel good about what I have going and plan to build even more tomorrow.

### Day 2: October 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Significant progress made today! I was able to add my red cups (created by me), buttons under the cups (to select choices) a 'show rules' button, and a media query upon screen resizing (will add more as time progresses).

**Thoughts** I had the hardest time with combining the cups and the buttons under the cups to move together. I tried positioning first but that didn't work too well. However, I succeeded in the end :) thankfully I had my HTML/CSS book on hand as reference. Turns out I ended up using positioning for the 'show rules'. I was happy about that because I don't really use positioning. Still moving forward!

### Day 3: October 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Built upon media queries from yesterday. Starting to understand and appreciate mobile-first approach even more. Also began the process of interactions occurring upon click for the cup's buttons.

**Thoughts** I loved diving deeper into responsive web design! It's such a great feeling to know that I am creating a better user experience for my audience, as well as adapting to the mobile-first world. Not sure if I want to make my media queries and responsiveness to device sizes "perfect", or just move on to the JS. I have an idea of how to make the ball appear and randomize its placement, which is exciting. Overall, pleased with my progress today.
