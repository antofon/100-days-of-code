# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Anwana Ntofon

### Day 1: October 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Start a small game that's based on shuffling three cups and finding a prize. Just HTML and CSS for now. JavaScript later perhaps?

**Thoughts** Not new to coding, but I still want to learn and strengthen fundamental concepts. For example, it took me way too long to center an 'a' tag. Nevertheless, I feel good about what I have going and plan to build even more tomorrow.
