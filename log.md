# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Anwana Ntofon

### Day 1: October 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Start a small game that's based on shuffling three cups and finding a prize. Just HTML and CSS for now. JavaScript later perhaps?

**Thoughts** Not new to coding, but I still want to learn and strengthen fundamental concepts. For example, it took me way too long to center an 'a' tag. Nevertheless, I feel good about what I have going and plan to build even more tomorrow.

### Day 2: October 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Significant progress made today! I was able to add my red cups (created by me), buttons under the cups (to select choices) a 'show rules' button, and a media query upon screen resizing (will add more as time progresses).

**Thoughts** I had the hardest time with combining the cups and the buttons under the cups to move together. I tried positioning first but that didn't work too well. However, I succeeded in the end :) thankfully I had my HTML/CSS book on hand as reference. Turns out I ended up using positioning for the 'show rules'. I was happy about that because I don't really use positioning. Still moving forward!

### Day 3: October 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Built upon media queries from yesterday. Starting to understand and appreciate mobile-first approach even more. Also began the process of interactions occurring upon click for the cup's buttons.

**Thoughts** I loved diving deeper into responsive web design! It's such a great feeling to know that I am creating a better user experience for my audience, as well as adapting to the mobile-first world. Not sure if I want to make my media queries and responsiveness to device sizes "perfect", or just move on to the JS. I have an idea of how to make the ball appear and randomize its placement, which is exciting. Overall, pleased with my progress today.

### Day 4: October 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Able to have metal ball appear if user guesses the correct position. Also randomized position number to have the user truly guess which cup is holding the metal ball. Refined a  media query a bit more and added another one (centered div element on 2nd row when the width of the top was 50% for each element).

**Thoughts** Pretty significant progress made today. I had an idea of how to randomize the position of the cups from a Treehouse tutorial I saw a couple of weeks ago. That and the W3Schools website. Wrote out my logic on a piece of paper and implemented it well. However, starting to have an issue with certain conditionals now. Need to backtrack and figure out why one button doesn't work, as well as the message showing for the other cup and not above the button I initially clicked. I'll solve it.

### Day 5: October 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Rough coding session today...still debugging my code. Tried switch statements, loops to ensure that code runs while user is on their first (and only) guess for the ball's position, etc. After a few hours I believe that I understand why I'm having trouble.

**Thoughts** I learned today that physical progress doesn't always need to be made. A lot of mental progress was made, and I'm happy with that. Today I learned a great deal of being creative and testing and running my code. I even used pen and paper to map out my ideas. I have hypothesis about why my code isn't running how I intended. More on that tomorrow.

### Day 6: October 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT!!!!! This is honestly the first project I fully completed that looks good on some mobile devices (android phone, iPod Touch). The initial start to this day was a ton of thinking and walking through the code before really typing anything out. But I accomplished it, and am ready to move on to the next project. Or add some more to this project? Who knows? We'll find out tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I learned not to give up! Keep trying, keep testing, keep thinking. Don't walk away permanently from a project. Read Docs, USE GOOGLE search, explore stackoverflow.com, EVERYTHING. There are many solutions to the problem you are trying to solve, you just need to discover "your" solution.

### Day 7: October 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Currently brainstorming for the next project, so I decided to work on the Basic JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp. Most likely will begin project tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I didn't want to rush into a new project right away before knowing what kind of skills I would need/gain. But I definitely don't want to ponder too long. Sometimes I need to remind myself to just DO.

### Day 8: October 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started my paint/drawing web project. Have the basic structure down and started adding some CSS. Going to explore Canvas this time around, so that should be fun.

**Thoughts** A significant amount of time was spent prior to coding to even come up with this idea. I should try to plan in advance or always be thinking about what's next, so I'm not in temporary limbo waiting for an idea to spark. I'm excited for this project though, going to learn a lot for sure.

### Day 9: October 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: More progress with constructing the buttons, 'Colors' and 'Sizes' tools for my painting/drawing web project. Didn't learn too much about Canvas as I was working on the other elements. That's okay though, I want to make sure those are taken care of before I jump into any unfamiliar tasks. Oh yea, I'm using SASS (SCSS version) for this project! Wanted to test it out and see how powerful it can be. So far, I'm impressed by how much quicker and maintainable my code is.

**Thoughts** Enjoying my pacing of the project so far. I've noticed that I'm more intentional when it comes to first structuring my HTML with groupings and semantic tags (nav, header, etc.) then going over to SCSS to style it up. Its been a bunch of fun so far learning SCSS too. Mixins are extremely helpful.

### Day 10: October 13, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Added size values for Size Tool and started working with Canvas and its drawing capabilities.

**Thoughts** Canvas is pretty tricky when it comes to drawing and even clearing itself. I found that the draw information is still presently if you go again to click in the area. I'm enjoying it though because I am seeing actual progress. I will continue to learn more about it and JS in general along the way.

### Day 11: October 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Portfolio, mainly Contact Page

**Thoughts** Decided to take a break from my drawing application to focus on something a bit more urgent - my portfolio website. Being that I'm learning SASS (SCSS), I thought it would be good to practice it here. The 'import' capability is awesome! It allows me to import chunks of CSS in one line, awesome. Going to keep working on this for some time until its complete. My most recent portfolio website was using Bootstrap 4. I decided to start over and actually use CSS (with the exception of SASS) so I learn the fundamentals first.

### Day 12: October 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on About Page for Portfolio Website

**Thoughts** Continuing on with my Portfolio website. So far so good, the About Page is coming along well. Once that is complete, I'll move on to the 'Home' and 'Portfolio' pages

### Day 13: October 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added CSS Reset to code, had to redo several element's alignments, font-sizes, etc. Went back to work on header and footer. Standardizing that so I can import the templated code into other stylesheets.

**Thoughts** I wish I had added a Reset in the beginning, the normalize.css file from the cdnjs.com website did not work how I intended. Maybe I don't understand the purpose of the file. In any event, it is a bit frustrating going back and having to alter code to my liking after the reset. Still, progress has been made.

### Day 14: October 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Working more with media queries, made 'About' page slightly more mobile-friendly.

**Thoughts** For some reason I'm having a lot of trouble with media queries. I think its my use of SASS and importing the CSS with the queries into another stylesheet and working from there. I'm thinking I should just format the alignment and placement of the content and then alter the font and other things afterwards. I don't want to stay here much longer but I want it to work across a wide range of devices.

### Day 15: October 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on 'About' page layout, went back to 'Contact' page to try to make responsive.

**Thoughts** Ugh, SASS is starting to confuse me when trying to make my website responsive. Its the nestedness, at first I understood it, but then I wanted to nest media queries inside my SCSS rules and now I'm just confused. Initially I was working on the 'About' page layout. But I went back to 'Contact' because that page was complete. Now working with responsive design, it's getting more confusing.

### Day 16: October 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Media Queries and understanding responsive web design. Created one webpage

**Thoughts** Made a mockup site to reinforce my understanding of media queries. Trying to implement a nice grid layout and go from there. Nothing fancy, just want to really understand mobile first design. Unfortunately, I didn't create a GitHub repo as I didn't think the webpage was worth saving. This is just an exercise.

### Day 17: October 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: FCC JavaScript tutorials: if, else if, else statements and switch statements.

**Thoughts** Light day today but at least wanted to make more FCC progress toward my Front End Development certificate

**Link(s) to work**
1. [freeCodeCamp site](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)


### Day 18: October 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: More FCC JavaScript tutorials (objects, loops, etc.)

**Thoughts** Even more JS progress. Hectic day today so I just wanted to get some more FCC challenges in. Starting to like these a bit more because I'm thinking more than usual. I'll need some scratch paper for this new FCC JS challenge, so that'll be fun. It's refreshing to actually think and use logic.

### Day 19: October 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Progress on mobile-first approach. Contact form is looking better on mobile. Form is almost centered.

**Thoughts** Yes! Things are going much better now. I must admit, I was hesitant to approach my portfolio site today because I knew all the headaches that would come with the responsive design implementation. But, I decided to tackle it anyway - looks like I'm started to figure things out (with the help of W3Schools I might add). It really is a mental game, building projects and all. Someone in the 100DaysofCode Twitter group recommended the Pomodoro Technique. Very helpful. Starting to bring back my enthusiasm and determination to complete this website.

### Day 20: October 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added more media queries to my Contact Page to have layout respond better to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.

**Thoughts** Although I feel as though I'm going back and forth with this mobile design approach (placing CSS rules meant for desktop into media queries and adding CSS rules outside of this for mobile devices), the process seems a bit more enjoyable. If I want things to happen at mobile, CSS rules are written straight away. Then as I increase the device size, I use more rules to describe how my layout responds. Hope to finish the footer section very soon so I can move on to another page.

### Day 21: October 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Challenges. Completed Basic JavaScript Challenges and moved on to Object Oriented & Functional Programming Challenges. Covered regular expressions, constructors, and array manipulation.

**Thoughts** Feels good to make progress on these freeCodeCamp challenges. Object Oriented & Functional Programming looks awesome, hope to implement it in future projects. I'm sure there's challenges that will use them.

### Day 22: October 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Went back to complete Bootstrap and jQuery challenges. Also completed the 'Reverse a String' challenge under 'Basic Algorithm Scripting'

**Thoughts** Decided to go back to complete the challenges I skipped over. I didn't feel like they were relevant to the progress I was making when I was doing 'Basic JavaScript' section (minus jQuery). Proud of myself for completing my first 'Basic Algorithm Scripting' challenge! String manipulation is interesting - not completely straightforward and you have to think about what JS functions will deliver the results you want. Great progress today. I'll probably go back to complete the Front End Development projects before I complete more Algorithm Challenges. Or do a bit of both...

### Day 23: October 26, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Making Progress with my Tribute Page for the Front End Development Project on freeCodeCamp. Content is of an image and a short bio so far.

**Thoughts** Tribute Page is looking great! Glad I found someone who I wasn't familiar with, it's made me even more interested in researching their biography. Also I think I'm actually starting to understand Bootstrap's Grid Layout! Much more work to do with this, but as long as I get to play more with Bootstrap and SASS I'm good. Having fun!

### Day 24: October 27, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tribute Page complete. Learned more about Bootstrap and SASS in the process.

**Thoughts** Well that was fun! Especially me starting to understand how media queries respond at different device sizes. I loved learning about Dr. Jemison for my freeCodeCamp Tribute Page too. Feels great to have a solid, responsive webpage complete, while also learning about an ambitious and inspirational Black woman in STEM.

### Day 25: October 28, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Working on freeCodeCamp Portfolio Project. Have most of content and styles for Home page. Somewhat responsive.

**Thoughts** I feel good about my progress today. Actually using Bootstrap to do what I want, which is cool. A framework sure does help. This has been my third time redoing my portfolio, but this time my mockup design is complete. I know exactly what I want my end result to be, just need to code it up.

### Day 26: October 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Homepage pretty much complete, Flat icons styled and provided corresponding body copy. Took more time to make their grid layout responsive. Also completed pre section with a nice orange button, and fixed width.

**Thoughts** Today went well. Had mini-challenges, but thankfully they didn't impede my progress. I do find that I am taking to much time trying to making things responsive or tweaking minor things, such as padding, or alignment. I just want things to look perfect right away, which is probably a mentality that slows me down. Going to try to keep that in mind when I work on another page tomorrow (About or Contact).

### Day 27: October 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Contact page complete, added validation, characters remaining when input in Message field, and styled overall form well. Looks good on mobile, desktop, and nearly everything in between. Began working on About page by providing the base style. Added profile picture and 'lorem ipsum' filler text.

**Thoughts** Tons of progress today. I started picking up steam once my base stylesheet was good to go. Although I tweaked some things, its function is pretty solidified. It allowed me to focus on the content that isn't the same throughout all webpages. The Contact Page went well, I even added JQuery to show how many characters were left in the message field. The About page went well too, I just imported the base stylesheet and could work on the main content just like the Contact page. The About should be done soon, possibly tomorrow.

### Day 28: October 31, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: About page Complete, Portfolio page nearly done. Added project panels, styled and responsive. Now need to add Bootstrap modals (aka dialogue windows) describing my projects.

**Thoughts** Almost done!. I breezed through the About page pretty quickly and drew inspiration from my peers to implement animated text! Still loving Bootstrap and SASS combo, it allows me to write my code much faster and avoid DRY (though I may need to polish everything when I am fully complete). The hardest part might be to implement Bootstrap modals since I have so many projects. I'm sure the process will be the same, it'll just be repetitive.

### Day 29: November 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: PORTFOLIO WEBSITE COMPLETE!!!! Wrapped up Portfolio page and added 3-bar icon for mobile - tablet devices

**Thoughts** Man, what a journey. It really has been more than a year in the making. I even tried redoing my portfolio twice! On this third try, with the accumulation of all my learning experiences and frustrations, I finally completed it. Although my site will undergo constant changes, for now, I'm happy with everything.

### Day 30: November 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up code on Codepen to pass freeCodeCamp's Personal Portfolio Webpage challenge. Attempted Palindrome algorithm, still working on it.

**Thoughts** The irony of building my portfolio site was that it was listed as a challenge on freeCodeCamp. Then, once I completed it, turns out that I didn't meet the site requirements. So, I had to make quite a bit of changes such as put all the content on one giant page. Moved on to the Palindrome algorithm but it's tricky, need to do more research on how to solve it.

### Day 31: November 3, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 Challenges under freeCodeCamp's Basic algorithm section for the Front End Developer Track

**Thoughts** I can't believe the amount progress I made today. 3 challenges! Yesterday I was struggling to get through the third one, now I've completed 3, 4 and 5! Instead of coding straight through, I found that scratch paper helped me walk through the logic and validate my reasoning on paper. I also utilized the Read-Search-Ask method a lot, to my benefit. Going to keep tackling these challenges, so far so good.

### Day 32: November 4, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 5 Challenges under freeCodeCamp's Basic algorithm section for the Front End Developer Track

**Thoughts** Great progress again today. Enjoying these challenges because they're strengthening my critical thinking skills and ability to research helpful information.

### Day 33: November 5, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1 Challenge under freeCodeCamp's Basic algorithm section for the Front End Developer Track

**Thoughts** Today was a bit tough, I tried attempting a few challenges but couldn't solve them in a reasonable time. So, I decided to switch to one that wasn't so taxing on the mind. Glad I could solve at least one today.

### Day 34: November 6, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1 Challenge under freeCodeCamp's Basic algorithm section for the Front End Developer Track. Went through JS section on Treehouse for Front End Web Developer Track

**Thoughts** These challenges are getting tougher...

### Day 35: November 7, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1 Challenge under freeCodeCamp's Basic algorithm section for the Front End Developer Track.

**Thoughts** Even if it's one a day, I'm glad I can still make progress by completing challenges.

### Day 36: November 8, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1 Challenge under freeCodeCamp's Basic algorithm section for the Front End Developer Track.

**Thoughts** Completed a challenge that I didn't even understand? A bit of plug-n-chug with a lot of hoping. It's all good though, when I went back to understand it, the solution made sense. Two more to go!

### Day 37: November 9, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed last two challenges for freeCodeCamp's Basic algorithm section for the Front End Developer Track. Completed JSON APIs and AJAX section on freeCodeCamp. Continued AJAX lessons on Treehouse.

**Thoughts** Glad to have finally completed all the algorithms! They were all challenging and didn't take 10-15 mins like I originally anticipated. Sometimes I had to switch gears or step away for a few hours. Now, I can continue through the Front End Developer Track and work on the first Intermediate Project: Build a Random Quote Machine.

### Day 38: November 10, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on HTML and CSS of Random Quote Machine, the first of freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Front End Developer Projects.

**Thoughts** So far so good, created a mockup and began coding the structure and styling of the webpage. I am anticipating those steps to be the easy parts. Maniupulating an API with JS and potentially AJAX will be the hard part.

### Day 39: November 11, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the HTML and CSS coding for Random Quote Machine. Also validated HTML and CSS successfully.

**Thoughts** Glad to complete and validate my code. I'm glad I even know how or where to validate my code, it lets me know that I am being more thoughtful as a developer. I want to continue validating my code and following best practices to strengthen my skill set. Now its off to learning more JS, AJAX, JSON, and APIs for the next phase of this project.

### Day 40: November 12, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked with XMLHttpRequest, getting data from a file, and injecting it into HTML.

**Thoughts** These new concepts like AJAX and HTTP requests are interesting and will take some time to learn. But I'm glad I made some progress in understanding them because I'm further in completing this challenge than I was yesterday.

### Day 41: November 13, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Understanding what happens when requests are made and the forismatic API is accessed. Tinkering with JSONP and reading documentation

**Thoughts** A lot of tinkering today. Really just trying to understand what is going on by doing and reading documentation. I think I should take a step back and really internalize what is going on when working with an API though.

### Day 42: November 14, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Treehouse tutorials on AJAX, JSONP, and APIs

**Thoughts** A bit lost still. Really wondering how to reach the desired input. I'll keep at it.

### Day 43: November 15, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Random Quote Machine working successfully. Twitter button added (does not post quote yet)

**Thoughts** Glad I remained persistent and was able to figure it out. Coding can really be a mental game. Now I just need to figure out how to post the quote on Twitter and this challenge will be complete. I presume I'll need to look up the Twitter API Doc. I got this.

### Day 44: November 16, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added post feature for Twitter button using Twitter Dev's Web Intent feature. Able to now tweet out the quote along with a hashtag. Random Quote Machine officially complete.

**Thoughts** Surprisingly, I was able to add the Tweet feature easily. I thought I would need to make another AJAX call and figure out how to work with JSON again. Glad I didn't think too hard and just read the Twitter Dev Docs. On to the next Intermediate Project!

### Day 45: November 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1 Challenge under freeCodeCamp's Intermediate algorithm section for the Front End Developer Track. Began exploring colors and typography for freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Front End Developer project: Show the Local Weather.

**Thoughts** Was a bit intimidated by the next level of algorithms. Solving at least one lets me know that I should not be worried or fearful. They're not meant to be easy, they're meant to make you a better problem solver and how you access information (docs, forums, etc.) On another note, I'm exploring colors and typography for my Weather API project.

### Day 46: November 18, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned a bit of Git. Created mockup for Local Weather App

**Thoughts** Felt a bit lost today because I wasn't into designing my project right away. It helped that I looked up some inspiration to get my creative juices flowing. Also I felt that now was the time to learn Git from the command line and understand how version control works. I'm going to use the command line through this project. Hopefully I don't break anything haha.

### Day 47: November 19, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Began coding HTML and CSS, main structure in place. Played more with Git.

**Thoughts** The Front End part of this project is coming together well. It'll look better with more CSS. Then I'll move on to the Weather API.

### Day 48: November 20, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added more HTML and CSS to work on the styling and structure. Played with positioning for the elements.

**Thoughts** Instead of working with box shadows in CSS I just created an SVG for my button. I probably should learn how to add drop shadows to buttons but for now I like my page design. One step closer to working on the API.

### Day 49: November 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML and CSS for local weather app. Switched out SVG button for an actual element button that "glows" on hover.

**Thoughts** Glad I was able to finalize my HTML and CSS. Extremely pleased with my button implementation. Deep down I wasn't happy with the hack of using an SVG because it didn't feel authentic/natural. So the actual creation of a button is great. Now I can put all my focus in this Weather API.

### Day 50: November 22, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented toggle feature for button

**Thoughts** Accomplished something different today. Thought I would dive into the API but I wanted to complete a toggle feature first. The holidays may impact the amount of work I do per day but I'll at least do an hour.

### Day 51: November 23, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed toggle feature but to now change between Celsius and Farenheit. Implemented HTML Geolocation feature.

**Thoughts** Very pleased that I was able to complete the toggle feature for my button. Before it wasn't displaying the correct text and wouldn't change from one temperature scale to the other. The Geolocation feature is awesome, used freeCodeCamp for reference to obtain longitude and latitude. Going to keep moving forward with this.

### Day 52: November 24, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Exploring different APIs that will help me obtain the user's city and name.

**Thoughts** No tangible progress today. Spend most of my time learning about APIs that could help me acquire information for the user's city and state. I tried the Google Maps API but I noticed on Stackoverflow that there are TOS (Terms of Service) rules stating that you must include Google Maps map if you're using their data? I know that its more specific than that but I've been making sure that I read documentation and understand the rules of using APIs, which is some level of progress. Sticking with it!

### Day 53: November 25, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Did 20+ levels on CSS Grid Garden

**Thoughts** Refreshing to have a change of pace and not so coding heavy. I enjoyed the game and learned quite a bit thus far

### Day 54: November 26, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on local weather app. Can now display correct local city and state of weather.

**Thoughts** Really glad that I was able to use an API that works for me. The Google Maps APIs TOS made me weary to use it. To my knowledge, the OpenCage Geocoder API should work out.

### Day 55: November 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on local weather app. Displays Farenheit and description. Adjusted button and main content positioning due to line break from city/state copy length.

**Thoughts** Progress, progress, progress. Using jQuery's getJSON method is very helpful and allowing me to understand how to the manipulate the data I acquire when the HTTP request is made. I should be wrapping up this project soon. I just need to display the correct image and enable the toggle feature to switch between Farenheit and Celsius. Also make the temp values display as whole numbers. I don't find it necessary to make them floating point numbers.

### Day 56: November 28, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Local Weather App. Implemented Toggle Button to change values between Farenheit and Celsius. Turned temperature values to whole numbers. Validated HTML and CSS code. Added JS strict mode with 'use-strict' directive.

**Thoughts** Yes I'm done! Really learned alot for this project including JSON, AJAX to make requests, and working with different APIs. With my code validated and I believe that what I've written is clean, readable, and secure. On to the next project!

### Day 57: November 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Working on bugs in Local Weather App. Seem to have fixed issue if the "city" property is not present in the user's respective JSON, made by the AJAX request.

**Thoughts** Glad to have reached out to others and received legitimate feedback in the form of snapshots, details about how info is being displayed, and other formats. That helps me fine-tune and improve upon projects such as these. I'll probably manually input some more latitude and longitude coordinates so I cover a reasonable amount of national and global cases. Then I'll ask for more feedback and move on to the Wikipedia Viewer.

### Day 60: December 2, Saturday

### Day 61: December 3, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Wrapping up HTML and CSS of Wikipedia Viewer. A few Flexbox Zombies challenges.

**Thoughts** Still going well, no major road blocks. Definitely learned a lot to avoid those pitfalls, positioning used to be confusing to me but I'm implmenting it well. I do want to go ahead and make this project responsive, so I'll have to make some unique media queries for the positioning elements. But it's going well.

### Day 62: December 4, Monday

**Today's Progress**: HTML and CSS complete (will validate after project completed). Began working on implementation of MediaWiki API.

**Thoughts** Happy with the progress made today. Although I got rid of the pink blocks on the sides on my query rectangles, I am happy with the pink transition effect I was able to implement on hover. Took a glance at the API and realized that this is just another challenge and an opportunity to understand a third-party API, which is exciting. More research on the API tomorrow.
