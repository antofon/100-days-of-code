# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Anwana Ntofon

### Day 1: October 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Start a small game that's based on shuffling three cups and finding a prize. Just HTML and CSS for now. JavaScript later perhaps?

**Thoughts** Not new to coding, but I still want to learn and strengthen fundamental concepts. For example, it took me way too long to center an 'a' tag. Nevertheless, I feel good about what I have going and plan to build even more tomorrow.

### Day 2: October 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Significant progress made today! I was able to add my red cups (created by me), buttons under the cups (to select choices) a 'show rules' button, and a media query upon screen resizing (will add more as time progresses).

**Thoughts** I had the hardest time with combining the cups and the buttons under the cups to move together. I tried positioning first but that didn't work too well. However, I succeeded in the end :) thankfully I had my HTML/CSS book on hand as reference. Turns out I ended up using positioning for the 'show rules'. I was happy about that because I don't really use positioning. Still moving forward!

### Day 3: October 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Built upon media queries from yesterday. Starting to understand and appreciate mobile-first approach even more. Also began the process of interactions occurring upon click for the cup's buttons.

**Thoughts** I loved diving deeper into responsive web design! It's such a great feeling to know that I am creating a better user experience for my audience, as well as adapting to the mobile-first world. Not sure if I want to make my media queries and responsiveness to device sizes "perfect", or just move on to the JS. I have an idea of how to make the ball appear and randomize its placement, which is exciting. Overall, pleased with my progress today.

### Day 4: October 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Able to have metal ball appear if user guesses the correct position. Also randomized position number to have the user truly guess which cup is holding the metal ball. Refined a  media query a bit more and added another one (centered div element on 2nd row when the width of the top was 50% for each element).

**Thoughts** Pretty significant progress made today. I had an idea of how to randomize the position of the cups from a Treehouse tutorial I saw a couple of weeks ago. That and the W3Schools website. Wrote out my logic on a piece of paper and implemented it well. However, starting to have an issue with certain conditionals now. Need to backtrack and figure out why one button doesn't work, as well as the message showing for the other cup and not above the button I initially clicked. I'll solve it.

### Day 5: October 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Rough coding session today...still debugging my code. Tried switch statements, loops to ensure that code runs while user is on their first (and only) guess for the ball's position, etc. After a few hours I believe that I understand why I'm having trouble.

**Thoughts** I learned today that physical progress doesn't always need to be made. A lot of mental progress was made, and I'm happy with that. Today I learned a great deal of being creative and testing and running my code. I even used pen and paper to map out my ideas. I have hypothesis about why my code isn't running how I intended. More on that tomorrow.

### Day 6: October 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT!!!!! This is honestly the first project I fully completed that looks good on some mobile devices (android phone, iPod Touch). The initial start to this day was a ton of thinking and walking through the code before really typing anything out. But I accomplished it, and am ready to move on to the next project. Or add some more to this project? Who knows? We'll find out tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I learned not to give up! Keep trying, keep testing, keep thinking. Don't walk away permanently from a project. Read Docs, USE GOOGLE search, explore stackoverflow.com, EVERYTHING. There are many solutions to the problem you are trying to solve, you just need to discover "your" solution.

### Day 7: October 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Currently brainstorming for the next project, so I decided to work on the Basic JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp. Most likely will begin project tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I didn't want to rush into a new project right away before knowing what kind of skills I would need/gain. But I definitely don't want to ponder too long. Sometimes I need to remind myself to just DO.

### Day 8: October 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started my paint/drawing web project. Have the basic structure down and started adding some CSS. Going to explore Canvas this time around, so that should be fun.

**Thoughts** A significant amount of time was spent prior to coding to even come up with this idea. I should try to plan in advance or always be thinking about what's next, so I'm not in temporary limbo waiting for an idea to spark. I'm excited for this project though, going to learn a lot for sure.

### Day 9: October 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: More progress with constructing the buttons, 'Colors' and 'Sizes' tools for my painting/drawing web project. Didn't learn too much about Canvas as I was working on the other elements. That's okay though, I want to make sure those are taken care of before I jump into any unfamiliar tasks. Oh yea, I'm using SASS (SCSS version) for this project! Wanted to test it out and see how powerful it can be. So far, I'm impressed by how much quicker and maintainable my code is.

**Thoughts** Enjoying my pacing of the project so far. I've noticed that I'm more intentional when it comes to first structuring my HTML with groupings and semantic tags (nav, header, etc.) then going over to SCSS to style it up. Its been a bunch of fun so far learning SCSS too. Mixins are extremely helpful.

### Day 10: October 13, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Added size values for Size Tool and started working with Canvas and its drawing capabilities.

**Thoughts** Canvas is pretty tricky when it comes to drawing and even clearing itself. I found that the draw information is still presently if you go again to click in the area. I'm enjoying it though because I am seeing actual progress. I will continue to learn more about it and JS in general along the way.

### Day 11: October 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Portfolio, mainly Contact Page

**Thoughts** Decided to take a break from my drawing application to focus on something a bit more urgent - my portfolio website. Being that I'm learning SASS (SCSS), I thought it would be good to practice it here. The 'import' capability is awesome! It allows me to import chunks of CSS in one line, awesome. Going to keep working on this for some time until its complete. My most recent portfolio website was using Bootstrap 4. I decided to start over and actually use CSS (with the exception of SASS) so I learn the fundamentals first.

### Day 12: October 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on About Page for Portfolio Website

**Thoughts** Continuing on with my Portfolio website. So far so good, the About Page is coming along well. Once that is complete, I'll move on to the 'Home' and 'Portfolio' pages

### Day 13: October 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added CSS Reset to code, had to redo several element's alignments, font-sizes, etc. Went back to work on header and footer. Standardizing that so I can import the templated code into other stylesheets.

**Thoughts** I wish I had added a Reset in the beginning, the normalize.css file from the cdnjs.com website did not work how I intended. Maybe I don't understand the purpose of the file. In any event, it is a bit frustrating going back and having to alter code to my liking after the reset. Still, progress has been made.

### Day 14: October 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Working more with media queries, made 'About' page slightly more mobile-friendly.

**Thoughts** For some reason I'm having a lot of trouble with media queries. I think its my use of SASS and importing the CSS with the queries into another stylesheet and working from there. I'm thinking I should just format the alignment and placement of the content and then alter the font and other things afterwards. I don't want to stay here much longer but I want it to work across a wide range of devices.

### Day 15: October 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on 'About' page layout, went back to 'Contact' page to try to make responsive.

**Thoughts** Ugh, SASS is starting to confuse me when trying to make my website responsive. Its the nestedness, at first I understood it, but then I wanted to nest media queries inside my SCSS rules and now I'm just confused. Initially I was working on the 'About' page layout. But I went back to 'Contact' because that page was complete. Now working with responsive design, it's getting more confusing.

### Day 16: October 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Media Queries and understanding responsive web design. Created one webpage

**Thoughts** Made a mockup site to reinforce my understanding of media queries. Trying to implement a nice grid layout and go from there. Nothing fancy, just want to really understand mobile first design. Unfortunately, I didn't create a GitHub repo as I didn't think the webpage was worth saving. This is just an exercise.

### Day 17: October 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: FCC JavaScript tutorials: if, else if, else statements and switch statements.

**Thoughts** Light day today but at least wanted to make more FCC progress toward my Front End Development certificate

### Day 18: October 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: More FCC JavaScript tutorials (objects, loops, etc.)

**Thoughts** Even more JS progress. Hectic day today so I just wanted to get some more FCC challenges in. Starting to like these a bit more because I'm thinking more than usual. I'll need some scratch paper for this new FCC JS challenge, so that'll be fun. It's refreshing to actually think and use logic.

### Day 19: October 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Progress on mobile-first approach. Contact form is looking better on mobile. Form is almost centered.

**Thoughts** Yes! Things are going much better now. I must admit, I was hesitant to approach my portfolio site today because I knew all the headaches that would come with the responsive design implementation. But, I decided to tackle it anyway - looks like I'm started to figure things out (with the help of W3Schools I might add). It really is a mental game, building projects and all. Someone in the 100DaysofCode Twitter group recommended the Pomodoro Technique. Very helpful. Starting to bring back my enthusiasm and determination to complete this website.

### Day 20: October 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added more media queries to my Contact Page to have layout respond better to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.

**Thoughts** Although I feel as though I'm going back and forth with this mobile design approach (placing CSS rules meant for desktop into media queries and adding CSS rules outside of this for mobile devices), the process seems a bit more enjoyable. If I want things to happen at mobile, CSS rules are written straight away. Then as I increase the device size, I use more rules to describe how my layout responds. Hope to finish the footer section very soon so I can move on to another page.

### Day 21: October 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Challenges. Completed Basic JavaScript Challenges and moved on to Object Oriented & Functional Programming Challenges. Covered regular expressions, constructors, and array manipulation.

**Thoughts** Feels good to make progress on these freeCodeCamp challenges. Object Oriented & Functional Programming looks awesome, hope to implement it in future projects. I'm sure there's challenges that will use them.

### Day 22: October 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Went back to complete Bootstrap and jQuery challenges. Also completed the 'Reverse a String' challenge under 'Basic Algorithm Scripting'

**Thoughts** Decided to go back to complete the challenges I skipped over. I didn't feel like they were relevant to the progress I was making when I was doing 'Basic JavaScript' section (minus jQuery). Proud of myself for completing my first 'Basic Algorithm Scripting' challenge! String manipulation is interesting - not completely straightforward and you have to think about what JS functions will deliver the results you want. Great progress today. I'll probably go back to complete the Front End Development projects before I complete more Algorithm Challenges. Or do a bit of both...

### Day 23: October 26, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Making Progress with my Tribute Page for the Front End Development Project on freeCodeCamp. Content is of an image and a short bio so far.

**Thoughts** Tribute Page is looking great! Glad I found someone who I wasn't familiar with, it's made me even more interested in researching their biography. Also I think I'm actually starting to understand Bootstrap's Grid Layout! Much more work to do with this, but as long as I get to play more with Bootstrap and SASS I'm good. Having fun!

### Day 24: October 27, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tribute Page complete. Learned more about Bootstrap and SASS in the process.

**Thoughts** Well that was fun! Especially me starting to understand how media queries respond at different device sizes. I loved learning about Dr. Jemison for my freeCodeCamp Tribute Page too. Feels great to have a solid, responsive webpage complete, while also learning about an ambitious and inspirational Black woman in STEM.

### Day 25: October 28, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Working on freeCodeCamp Portfolio Project. Have most of content and styles for Home page. Somewhat responsive.

**Thoughts** I feel good about my progress today. Actually using Bootstrap to do what I want, which is cool. A framework sure does help. This has been my third time redoing my portfolio, but this time my mockup design is complete. I know exactly what I want my end result to be, just need to code it up.

### Day 26: October 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Homepage pretty much complete, Flat icons styled and provided corresponding body copy. Took more time to make their grid layout responsive. Also completed pre section with a nice orange button, and fixed width.

**Thoughts** Today went well. Had mini-challenges, but thankfully they didn't impede my progress. I do find that I am taking to much time trying to making things responsive or tweaking minor things, such as padding, or alignment. I just want things to look perfect right away, which is probably a mentality that slows me down. Going to try to keep that in mind when I work on another page tomorrow (About or Contact).
