# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Anwana Ntofon

### Day 1: October 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Start a small game that's based on shuffling three cups and finding a prize. Just HTML and CSS for now. JavaScript later perhaps?

**Thoughts** Not new to coding, but I still want to learn and strengthen fundamental concepts. For example, it took me way too long to center an 'a' tag. Nevertheless, I feel good about what I have going and plan to build even more tomorrow.

### Day 2: October 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Significant progress made today! I was able to add my red cups (created by me), buttons under the cups (to select choices) a 'show rules' button, and a media query upon screen resizing (will add more as time progresses).

**Thoughts** I had the hardest time with combining the cups and the buttons under the cups to move together. I tried positioning first but that didn't work too well. However, I succeeded in the end :) thankfully I had my HTML/CSS book on hand as reference. Turns out I ended up using positioning for the 'show rules'. I was happy about that because I don't really use positioning. Still moving forward!

### Day 3: October 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Built upon media queries from yesterday. Starting to understand and appreciate mobile-first approach even more. Also began the process of interactions occurring upon click for the cup's buttons.

**Thoughts** I loved diving deeper into responsive web design! It's such a great feeling to know that I am creating a better user experience for my audience, as well as adapting to the mobile-first world. Not sure if I want to make my media queries and responsiveness to device sizes "perfect", or just move on to the JS. I have an idea of how to make the ball appear and randomize its placement, which is exciting. Overall, pleased with my progress today.

### Day 4: October 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Able to have metal ball appear if user guesses the correct position. Also randomized position number to have the user truly guess which cup is holding the metal ball. Refined a  media query a bit more and added another one (centered div element on 2nd row when the width of the top was 50% for each element).

**Thoughts** Pretty significant progress made today. I had an idea of how to randomize the position of the cups from a Treehouse tutorial I saw a couple of weeks ago. That and the W3Schools website. Wrote out my logic on a piece of paper and implemented it well. However, starting to have an issue with certain conditionals now. Need to backtrack and figure out why one button doesn't work, as well as the message showing for the other cup and not above the button I initially clicked. I'll solve it.

### Day 5: October 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Rough coding session today...still debugging my code. Tried switch statements, loops to ensure that code runs while user is on their first (and only) guess for the ball's position, etc. After a few hours I believe that I understand why I'm having trouble.

**Thoughts** I learned today that physical progress doesn't always need to be made. A lot of mental progress was made, and I'm happy with that. Today I learned a great deal of being creative and testing and running my code. I even used pen and paper to map out my ideas. I have hypothesis about why my code isn't running how I intended. More on that tomorrow.

### Day 6: October 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT!!!!! This is honestly the first project I fully completed that looks good on some mobile devices (android phone, iPod Touch). The initial start to this day was a ton of thinking and walking through the code before really typing anything out. But I accomplished it, and am ready to move on to the next project. Or add some more to this project? Who knows? We'll find out tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I learned not to give up! Keep trying, keep testing, keep thinking. Don't walk away permanently from a project. Read Docs, USE GOOGLE search, explore stackoverflow.com, EVERYTHING. There are many solutions to the problem you are trying to solve, you just need to discover "your" solution.

### Day 7: October 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Currently brainstorming for the next project, so I decided to work on the Basic JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp. Most likely will begin project tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I didn't want to rush into a new project right away before knowing what kind of skills I would need/gain. But I definitely don't want to ponder too long. Sometimes I need to remind myself to just DO.
