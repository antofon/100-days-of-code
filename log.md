# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Anwana Ntofon

### Day 1: October 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Start a small game that's based on shuffling three cups and finding a prize. Just HTML and CSS for now. JavaScript later perhaps?

**Thoughts** Not new to coding, but I still want to learn and strengthen fundamental concepts. For example, it took me way too long to center an 'a' tag. Nevertheless, I feel good about what I have going and plan to build even more tomorrow.

### Day 2: October 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Significant progress made today! I was able to add my red cups (created by me), buttons under the cups (to select choices) a 'show rules' button, and a media query upon screen resizing (will add more as time progresses).

**Thoughts** I had the hardest time with combining the cups and the buttons under the cups to move together. I tried positioning first but that didn't work too well. However, I succeeded in the end :) thankfully I had my HTML/CSS book on hand as reference. Turns out I ended up using positioning for the 'show rules'. I was happy about that because I don't really use positioning. Still moving forward!

### Day 3: October 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Built upon media queries from yesterday. Starting to understand and appreciate mobile-first approach even more. Also began the process of interactions occurring upon click for the cup's buttons.

**Thoughts** I loved diving deeper into responsive web design! It's such a great feeling to know that I am creating a better user experience for my audience, as well as adapting to the mobile-first world. Not sure if I want to make my media queries and responsiveness to device sizes "perfect", or just move on to the JS. I have an idea of how to make the ball appear and randomize its placement, which is exciting. Overall, pleased with my progress today.

### Day 4: October 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Able to have metal ball appear if user guesses the correct position. Also randomized position number to have the user truly guess which cup is holding the metal ball. Refined a  media query a bit more and added another one (centered div element on 2nd row when the width of the top was 50% for each element).

**Thoughts** Pretty significant progress made today. I had an idea of how to randomize the position of the cups from a Treehouse tutorial I saw a couple of weeks ago. That and the W3Schools website. Wrote out my logic on a piece of paper and implemented it well. However, starting to have an issue with certain conditionals now. Need to backtrack and figure out why one button doesn't work, as well as the message showing for the other cup and not above the button I initially clicked. I'll solve it.

### Day 5: October 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Rough coding session today...still debugging my code. Tried switch statements, loops to ensure that code runs while user is on their first (and only) guess for the ball's position, etc. After a few hours I believe that I understand why I'm having trouble.

**Thoughts** I learned today that physical progress doesn't always need to be made. A lot of mental progress was made, and I'm happy with that. Today I learned a great deal of being creative and testing and running my code. I even used pen and paper to map out my ideas. I have hypothesis about why my code isn't running how I intended. More on that tomorrow.

### Day 6: October 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT!!!!! This is honestly the first project I fully completed that looks good on some mobile devices (android phone, iPod Touch). The initial start to this day was a ton of thinking and walking through the code before really typing anything out. But I accomplished it, and am ready to move on to the next project. Or add some more to this project? Who knows? We'll find out tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I learned not to give up! Keep trying, keep testing, keep thinking. Don't walk away permanently from a project. Read Docs, USE GOOGLE search, explore stackoverflow.com, EVERYTHING. There are many solutions to the problem you are trying to solve, you just need to discover "your" solution.

### Day 7: October 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Currently brainstorming for the next project, so I decided to work on the Basic JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp. Most likely will begin project tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I didn't want to rush into a new project right away before knowing what kind of skills I would need/gain. But I definitely don't want to ponder too long. Sometimes I need to remind myself to just DO.

### Day 8: October 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started my paint/drawing web project. Have the basic structure down and started adding some CSS. Going to explore Canvas this time around, so that should be fun.

**Thoughts** A significant amount of time was spent prior to coding to even come up with this idea. I should try to plan in advance or always be thinking about what's next, so I'm not in temporary limbo waiting for an idea to spark. I'm excited for this project though, going to learn a lot for sure.

### Day 9: October 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: More progress with constructing the buttons, 'Colors' and 'Sizes' tools for my painting/drawing web project. Didn't learn too much about Canvas as I was working on the other elements. That's okay though, I want to make sure those are taken care of before I jump into any unfamiliar tasks. Oh yea, I'm using SASS (SCSS version) for this project! Wanted to test it out and see how powerful it can be. So far, I'm impressed by how much quicker and maintainable my code is.

**Thoughts** Enjoying my pacing of the project so far. I've noticed that I'm more intentional when it comes to first structuring my HTML with groupings and semantic tags (nav, header, etc.) then going over to SCSS to style it up. Its been a bunch of fun so far learning SCSS too. Mixins are extremely helpful.

### Day 10: October 13, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Added size values for Size Tool and started working with Canvas and its drawing capabilities.

**Thoughts** Canvas is pretty tricky when it comes to drawing and even clearing itself. I found that the draw information is still presently if you go again to click in the area. I'm enjoying it though because I am seeing actual progress. I will continue to learn more about it and JS in general along the way.

### Day 11: October 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Portfolio, mainly Contact Page

**Thoughts** Decided to take a break from my drawing application to focus on something a bit more urgent - my portfolio website. Being that I'm learning SASS (SCSS), I thought it would be good to practice it here. The 'import' capability is awesome! It allows me to import chunks of CSS in one line, awesome. Going to keep working on this for some time until its complete. My most recent portfolio website was using Bootstrap 4. I decided to start over and actually use CSS (with the exception of SASS) so I learn the fundamentals first.

### Day 12: October 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on About Page for Portfolio Website

**Thoughts** Continuing on with my Portfolio website. So far so good, the About Page is coming along well. Once that is complete, I'll move on to the 'Home' and 'Portfolio' pages

### Day 13: October 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added CSS Reset to code, had to redo several element's alignments, font-sizes, etc. Went back to work on header and footer. Standardizing that so I can import the templated code into other stylesheets.

**Thoughts** I wish I had added a Reset in the beginning, the normalize.css file from the cdnjs.com website did not work how I intended. Maybe I don't understand the purpose of the file. In any event, it is a bit frustrating going back and having to alter code to my liking after the reset. Still, progress has been made.
